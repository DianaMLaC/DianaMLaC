Hey there, fellow tech wizards! I'm Diana, and this is where I turn concepts into reality through the magic of code and a sprinkle of creativity.

### About Me

I'm a tech fairy, bringing wild ideas to life with a touch of magic and a lot of code. From full-stack development to optimizing systems, I enjoy navigating the challenges and wonders of the digital realm. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [KDFG](https://kdfg-frontend.vercel.app/Home).
- Check out my Full-Stack portfolio project at [Faebook](https://github.com/DianaMLaC/faebook).
  
### Tech Stack

Diving into the nitty-gritty, here's what I'm all about:

- Ruby on Rails is my magic wand for crafting robust back-end architectures. 🪄
- JavaScript is my spell-book for creating interactive and dynamic web experiences. 📜
- With TypeScript, I balance JavaScript's flexibility with the power of strong typing. 🛡️
- With React, I sculpt user experiences that are fast, responsive, and engaging. :atom_symbol:
- CSS is the brush I use to paint visually stunning webpages :art:
- Version control with Git is my safety net 🕸️, ensuring every line of code is tracked and secure. 🔒
